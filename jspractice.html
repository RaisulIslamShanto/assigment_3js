      the difference between let var and constant in js var can be assigned and
      declared multiple time such var x= 6; var x=7; it will not show error but
      it will take the last value for print;<br />
      but for let let x= 10; let x= "king"; it will show error and it will store
      only first value 10 for x;<br />
      and for constant; const Pi = 3.14; Pi = 3.15; it will give error as pi is
      assigned ;
